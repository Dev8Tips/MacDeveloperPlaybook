## Do This First!
` `
## Configuring a User Account
` `
### Configuring The Trackpad
` `
### Creating a Private Applications Folder
` `
### Securing the Safari Browser
` `
## Configuring Security
` `
### Basic Settings
` `
### Enable File Vault NOW
` `
### Set a Firmware Password
` `
## Setting Up Time Machine Backups
` `
## Setting Up for Development

### Getting Xcode
` `
### Setting Up Homebrew
` `
### Installing the Git Version Control System
` `
### Choosing a Text Editor
` `
### Customizing Your Text Editor
` `
### Setting Up A Directory Structure for Projects
` `
- I use the directory `~/Developer` as the root of my development-related files. 
- `~/Developer/Code` => place holder for code snippets, tutorial code, test ideas, etc.
- `~/Developer/Environments` => virtual environments to keep the dependencies required by different projects in separate places
- `~/Developer/Infrastructure` => Placeholder for virtual machines and infrastructure as code
- `~/Developer/Projects` directory to hold in-development projects. This contains a few subdirectories, including -
  - `Archives` for projects I've abandoned, and 
  - `Current` for current development work. 
- `~/Projects` is also a symlink to `~/Developer/Projects/Current`

My code is organised as follows: 

```
code/
  dev-thirdparty/ => 3rd party code I've downloaded and want to keep around
  dev/ => projects that are not in source control (tutorials, tests, experiments, etc.)
  src/ => my source control checkouts
    bitbucket.org/
      my-bitbucket-username/
        a-project/
    github.com/
      my-github-username/
        another-project/
```

### Creating SSH Keys

## Setting Up Environments
` `
### nvm and Yarn for Node.js Development

` `
### RVM for Ruby Development
` `
### pyenv for Python Development
` `
### A Lightweight Setup for Python 2 Development

## SQL Databases
` `
### Installing PostgreSQL
` `
### Installing MariaDB or MySQL

This document describes how I set up my development environment on a new MacBookPro. We will set up a foundation stack covering shell, text editors, version control, python/scala/javascript and other programming languages; followed by a Big Data Analytics stack for data product development work.

This work is inspired by the a similar repository maintained by @nicolahery and this amazing gitbook Mac OS X Setup Guide.

## Do This First!
` `
## Configuring a User Account
` `
### Configuring The Trackpad
` `
### Creating a Private Applications Folder
` `
### Securing the Safari Browser
` `
## Configuring Security
` `
### Basic Settings
` `
### Enable File Vault NOW
` `
### Set a Firmware Password
` `
## Setting Up Time Machine Backups
` `
## Setting Up for Development
` `
### Getting Xcode
` `
### Setting Up Homebrew
` `
### Installing the Git Version Control System
` `
### Choosing a Text Editor
` `
### Customizing Your Text Editor
` `
### Setting Up A Directory Structure for Projects
` `
- I use the directory `~/Developer` as the root of my development-related files. 
- `~/Developer/Code` => place holder for code snippets, tutorial code, test ideas, etc.
- `~/Developer/Environments` => virtual environments to keep the dependencies required by different projects in separate places
- `~/Developer/Infrastructure` => Placeholder for virtual machines and infrastructure as code
- `~/Developer/Projects` directory to hold in-development projects. This contains a few subdirectories, including -
  - `Archives` for projects I've abandoned, and 
  - `Current` for current development work. 
- `~/Projects` is also a symlink to `~/Developer/Projects/Current`

My code is organised as follows: 

```
code/
  dev-thirdparty/ => 3rd party code I've downloaded and want to keep around
  dev/ => projects that are not in source control (tutorials, tests, experiments, etc.)
  src/ => my source control checkouts
    bitbucket.org/
      my-bitbucket-username/
        a-project/
    github.com/
      my-github-username/
        another-project/
```

### Creating SSH Keys
` `


## Setting Up Environments
` `
### nvm and Yarn for Node.js Development

### Setting a Custom GOPATH
` `

` `
### RVM for Ruby Development
` `
### pyenv for Python Development
` `
### A Lightweight Setup for Python 2 Development

This document describes how I set up my development environment on a new MacBookPro. We will set up a foundation stack covering shell, text editors, version control, python/scala/javascript and other programming languages; followed by a Big Data Analytics stack for data product development work.

This work is inspired by the a similar repository maintained by @nicolahery and this amazing gitbook Mac OS X Setup Guide.

## Do This First!
` `
## Configuring a User Account
` `
### Configuring The Trackpad
` `
### Creating a Private Applications Folder
` `
### Securing the Safari Browser
` `
## Configuring Security
` `
### Basic Settings
` `
### Enable File Vault NOW
` `
### Set a Firmware Password
` `
## Setting Up Time Machine Backups
` `
## Setting Up for Development
` `
### Getting Xcode
` `
### Setting Up Homebrew
` `
### Installing the Git Version Control System
` `
### Choosing a Text Editor
` `
### Customizing Your Text Editor
` `
### Setting Up A Directory Structure for Projects
` `
- I use the directory `~/Developer` as the root of my development-related files. 
- `~/Developer/Code` => place holder for code snippets, tutorial code, test ideas, etc.
- `~/Developer/Environments` => virtual environments to keep the dependencies required by different projects in separate places
- `~/Developer/Infrastructure` => Placeholder for virtual machines and infrastructure as code
- `~/Developer/Projects` directory to hold in-development projects. This contains a few subdirectories, including -
  - `Archives` for projects I've abandoned, and 
  - `Current` for current development work. 
- `~/Projects` is also a symlink to `~/Developer/Projects/Current`

My code is organised as follows: 

```
code/
  dev-thirdparty/ => 3rd party code I've downloaded and want to keep around
  dev/ => projects that are not in source control (tutorials, tests, experiments, etc.)
  src/ => my source control checkouts
    bitbucket.org/
      my-bitbucket-username/
        a-project/
    github.com/
      my-github-username/
        another-project/
```

### Creating SSH Keys

### RVM for Ruby Development
` `
### pyenv for Python Development
` `
### A Lightweight Setup for Python 2 Development

This document describes how I set up my development environment on a new MacBookPro. We will set up a foundation stack covering shell, text editors, version control, python/scala/javascript and other programming languages; followed by a Big Data Analytics stack for data product development work.

This work is inspired by the a similar repository maintained by @nicolahery and this amazing gitbook Mac OS X Setup Guide.

<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>Title</title><meta charset="utf-8"><link href="styles/presentation.css" rel="stylesheet" /></head><body><textarea id="source"># The Hitchhiker's Guide to MacOSX Development Environment Best Practices

This document describes how I set up my development environment on a new MacBookPro. We will set up a foundation stack covering shell, text editors, version control, python/scala/javascript and other programming languages; followed by a Big Data Analytics stack for data product development work.

This work is inspired by the a similar repository maintained by @nicolahery and this amazing gitbook Mac OS X Setup Guide.

# Setting Up an Apple Mac for Software Development

Adapted from [__source__](http://www.stuartellis.name/articles/mac-setup/#setting-up-a-directory-structure-for-projects)
## Do This First!
` `
## Configuring a User Account
` `
### Configuring The Trackpad
` `
### Creating a Private Applications Folder
` `
### Securing the Safari Browser
` `
## Configuring Security
` `
### Basic Settings
` `
### Enable File Vault NOW
` `
### Set a Firmware Password
` `
## Setting Up Time Machine Backups
` `
## Setting Up for Development
` `
### Getting Xcode
` `
### Setting Up Homebrew
` `
### Installing the Git Version Control System
` `
### Choosing a Text Editor
` `
### Customizing Your Text Editor
` `
### Setting Up A Directory Structure for Projects
` `
- I use the directory `~/Developer` as the root of my development-related files. 
- `~/Developer/Code` => place holder for code snippets, tutorial code, test ideas, etc.
- `~/Developer/Environments` => virtual environments to keep the dependencies required by different projects in separate places
- `~/Developer/Infrastructure` => Placeholder for virtual machines and infrastructure as code
- `~/Developer/Projects` directory to hold in-development projects. This contains a few subdirectories, including -
  - `Archives` for projects I've abandoned, and 
  - `Current` for current development work. 
- `~/Projects` is also a symlink to `~/Developer/Projects/Current`

My code is organised as follows: 

```
code/
  dev-thirdparty/ => 3rd party code I've downloaded and want to keep around
  dev/ => projects that are not in source control (tutorials, tests, experiments, etc.)
  src/ => my source control checkouts
    bitbucket.org/
      my-bitbucket-username/
        a-project/
    github.com/
      my-github-username/
        another-project/
```

### Creating SSH Keys

## Setting Up Environments
` `
### nvm and Yarn for Node.js Development

### Developer Tools for Go
` `
### Setting a Custom GOPATH
` `

` `
### RVM for Ruby Development
` `
### pyenv for Python Development
