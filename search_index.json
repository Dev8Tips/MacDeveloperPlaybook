Hitchhiker's Guide to MacOSX Development Environment Best Practices\nThis document describes how I set up my development environment on a new MacBookPro. We will set up a foundation stack covering shell, text editors, version control, python/scala/javascript and other programming languages; followed by a Big Data Analytics stack for data product development work.\nThis work is inspired by the a similar repository maintained by @nicolahery and this amazing gitbook Mac OS X Setup Guide.\nCore MacOSX Configurations\n\nSetting Up an Apple Mac for Software Development\nHomebrew Package Manager\nTerminal\n\n\n"},"GLOSSARY.html":{"url":"GLOSSARY.html","keywords":"","body":""},"core/macosx-getting-started.html":{"url":"core/macosx-getting-started.html","title":"Getting Started","keywords":"","body":"Setting Up an Apple Mac for Software Development\nAdapted from source\nDo This First!\n \nConfiguring a User Account\n \nConfiguring The Trackpad\n \nCreating a Private Applications Folder\n \nSecuring the Safari Browser\n \nConfiguring Security\n \nBasic Settings\n \nEnable File Vault NOW\n \nSet a Firmware Password\n \nSetting Up Time Machine Backups\n \nSetting Up for Development\n \nGetting Xcode\n \nSetting Up Homebrew\n \nInstalling the Git Version Control System\n \nChoosing a Text Editor\n \nCustomizing Your Text Editor\n \nSetting Up A Directory Structure for Projects\n \n\nI use the directory ~/Developer as the root of my development-related files. \n~/Developer/Code => place holder for code snippets, tutorial code, test ideas, etc.\n~/Developer/Environments => virtual environments to keep the dependencies required by different projects in separate places\n~/Developer/Infrastructure => Placeholder for virtual machines and infrastructure as code\n~/Developer/Projects directory to hold in-development projects.
